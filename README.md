## WHAT'S THE VIBE???

This project allows the use to search for a keyword, which then pulls 50 tweets via the Tweepy library and Twitter API.

The app then analyses and summarises the tweets using the Textblob library and Open AI models to return a sentiment analysis based on words and language used in the tweets, and a deeper reading into context and slang using the Open AI API.

I hope you gain some useful insights using the app. 

Thanks,
Yon
